# Getting started designing for Kunai

Awesome! You're about to become a Kunai UX Designer!

<a href="#"><img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/jCFROL1Ivwcvu/giphy.gif?cid=3640f6095c67017d4f50375a499b5cfe" alt="Gooble Gobble, One of Us" border="0"></a>

Below you'll find everything you need to start designing. If something is missing, add it (as goes with everything at Kunai)!

You will feel very slow in the beginning, that is perfectly normal. There is a lot of information being thrown at you all at once. Your goal for the first few weeks here is simply to listen, absorb, and ask as many questions as possible.

If you haven't already, please read the main section of the [UX Handbook](ux/handbook.md) and the [UX Designer section]().

## UX Design Buddy

You will be assigned a UX Buddy to help you find your way around. Your buddy will schedule a chat with you during your first week. They will also be assigned to your first few projects alongside you. While you should feel free to ask anyone for help at anytime, your buddy is a dedicated person you can rely on for help and guidance.

## Design tools

Every UX designer gets a license to Sketch, Invision, Abstract, and Zeplin. Other tools as needed can include, but are not limited to: Framer, Origami by Facebook, Principle for Mac, and Adobe Creative Suite.

Your manager will be able to provide you with designer tool licenses. When in need of different tools, request those by filing an issue on our organization issue tracker.

As part of your day-to-day, you will be working in Abstract. This is where we host design files and keep Version Control. We use Zeplin to share them with developers for implementation. For details on how to work and contribute to this repo, read the contribution guidelines.


## Help Outside

We encourage you to get to know any, and everyone at Kunai so you can send a couple of random 'Hello's' and strike up a conversation. A couple of really friendly folks at Kunai are:

- Andrii Gorishnii (Developer)
- Angela Milash (Product Manager)
- Sean Kim (UX Designer)
- Velco Farina (Business Development)
