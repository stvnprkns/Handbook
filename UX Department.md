# UX Department
We create intuitive, delightful and beauitufl software for a myriad of clients. We build products for for both our clients, and also their end users.

The UX Department works cross-functionally internally and with the Development, Product, and Biz Dev departments to meet these goals. We are the experts in our field, clients hire us to build what they need and we use our unique skills and perspectives to make that product the absolute best.

## UX Vision

### Principles
Kunai's focus is on financial technology companies these products can sometimes seem cold, and transactional. It is our job to make these products personal, emotional, and human, while maintaining a high-level of design and visualization. 


#### Everyone is a Designer
_Self-aware. Emotional, yet rational. Understandable and helpful._

Design is another word for problem-solving. We all have different perspectives whether it's understanding psychology, user behavior, product architecture, business methods, client expectations, etc. Therefore everyone at Kunai has valueable opinions on possible solutions, and as designers, we are the leaders to help them express those. 

**User Experience is part of everything we do.**

User experience is in every stage of the product from SOW to final development.

**Everyone at Kunai has a say in the experience.**

- We encourage everyone (Product Managers, Engineers, etc.) to contribute thoughts ideas, and sketches for solutions. Everyone is a designer.
- Designers involve Product Managers and Engineers in problem discovery and definition.
- Designers, Product Managers, and Engineers are involved in UX research, and backing solutions with data.


**Our solutions make users feel confident and efficient.**

- Use the simplest most boring solution for a problem.
- Maintain proven best practices.
- Understand the user's goals and circumstances.
- Respect the importance of their work, and avoid gimicky design.
- Users receive sufficient feedback and direction to achieve their goals.
- Design holistic experiences and flows.


#### Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
_Simplicity and modulatrity drive maximum efficency._


**Design is about iteration, we continuously iterate on our processes.**

- Aggressively break down issues into the smallest effort that gets results.
- The design system will never be finished; it should always be evolving.
- Always, start in low-fidelity (sketches, wireframes, greyscale, etc.) to make sure we get it right before we go any further.
- Reuse components, buttons, type-styles, layout skeletons, form-fields, etc. to save effort and time for the deeper design thinking.


**Minimize distractions and clutter so users can focus.**

- Understand the users' journey and goals.
- Create hierarchy and a sense of direction to guide users through the flow.
- Maintain a strong information architecture.
- Don't be afraid to remove things that don't contribute to the user flow.


#### Human
_Self-aware. Emotional, yet rational. Understandable and helpful._

The biggest, and most difficult part of designing for FinTech is turning a financial product into something that isn't just a transactional peice of software, but an emotional, and personal interaction.

**Ambition**

- Think big, but break it down into small steps.
- Don’t be afraid to ask stupid questions, or propose new ideas.
- We're a small yet talented company; we should embrace it and push the products we work on to always be great.


**Empathy**

- See the world through other people's eyes, and try to understand their experiences deeply and meaningfully.
- Don’t overload the user.
- Don’t reinvent the wheel, unless you need to.
- Assist your teammates, always.


## Workflow
The UX Department is one side of the Triangle Δ. We work alongside Product Managers (PMs), and Engineers (FE / BE). PMs are responsible for kicking-off projects, coordinating timelines, sprints, and deliverable dates. PMs facilitate communication between Kunai and the clients and give the creative team the space to create and develop the product.

UX is the pilot driving the product vision early in the process. We inform the vision by conducting research as well as facilitating discussion with clients, customers, PM, FE, and BE. We do the entire spectrum of design work from research, to sketching, sitemapping, prototyping, and designing gradients on buttons.


## Holistic UX
The focus is always on the end experience for the customer. We must maintain a focus on what the user needs to get done and how to deliver that in the most effective manner possible. This includes how users flow from one stage of the product to another. Maintaining a holistic overview of the path a user may take allows us to see the possible twists and turns along the way. With this knowledge, we can optimize the user experience.

## Design Consistency
Though we structure our work around individual projects we always create consistency, across each product. We do this by using the Kunai Library components, or developing new components for the library that may be specific to your project. This is not to say that everything is templatized, or cookie-cutter. We've built a very modular and adaptable library so that we can easily use components like form-fields, buttons, and type-styles in any project and easily edit them.


#### Everyone can contribute
The UX department is not solely responsible for the user experience at Kunai. Everyone is encouraged to contribute their thoughts and ideas on how we can make our projects better, and our internal processes more efficient. Open an issue and tell us about your idea. You can use just words or include images. These images can take a variety of forms, here are just a few examples:

- Drawings, Wireframes or sketches to convey your idea.
- Low-fidelity mockups made by manipulating the DOM in the browser.
- Non-Designers who want a more high-fidelity mock of the idea, just connect with them over Slack, we're always more than happy to help create these.


## UX Resources

#### Kunai Design Tools

Here is a list of tools we use to get our design work done at Kunai. [Click here]() for more information on how we use them.

- Abstract (Version Control)
- Sketch (Mocks and Wires)
- Google Drive (Storage)
- Zeplin (Asset Delivery)
- Slack (Communication)
- Adobe Creative Suite (as needed)


#### Kunai Design System

We developed the Kunai Design Library to speed up visual design time by creating a giant library of hyper-modular elements such as buttons, form-fields, avatars, type-styles, colors, and so much more.

This helps us to increase iteration speed and bring consistency to the UI through the creation of reusable and robust components. This system allows designers to focus their efforts on solving user needs, rather than recreating elements and reinventing solutions. It also empowers Product, engineering, and the community to use these defined patterns when proposing solutions. The Design System can be [downloaded here](). It is currently a work in progress.
