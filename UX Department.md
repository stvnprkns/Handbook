# UX Department
We create intuitive, delightful and beauitufl software for a myriad of clients. We build products for for both our clients, and also their end users.

The UX Department works cross-functionally internally and with the Development, Product, and Biz Dev departments to meet these goals. We are the experts in our field, clients hire us to build what they need and we use our unique skills and perspectives to make that product the absolute best.

## UX Vision

### Principles
Kunai's focus is on financial technology companies these products can sometimes seem cold, and transactional. It is our job to make these products personal, emotional, and human, while maintaining a high-level of design and visualization. 


#### Everyone is a Designer
_Self-aware. Emotional, yet rational. Understandable and helpful._

Design is another word for problem-solving. We all have different perspectives whether it's understanding psychology, user behavior, product architecture, business methods, client expectations, etc. Therefore everyone at Kunai has valueable opinions on possible solutions, and as designers, we are the leaders to help them express those. 

**User Experience is part of everything we do.**

User experience is in every stage of the product from SOW to final development.

**Everyone at Kunai has a say in the experience.**

- We encourage everyone (Product Managers, Engineers, etc.) to contribute thoughts ideas, and sketches for solutions. Everyone is a designer.
- Designers involve Product Managers and Engineers in problem discovery and definition.
- Designers, Product Managers, and Engineers are involved in UX research, and backing solutions with data.


**Our solutions make users feel confident and efficient.**

- Use the simplest most boring solution for a problem.
- Maintain proven best practices.
- Understand the user's goals and circumstances.
- Respect the importance of their work, and avoid gimicky design.
- Users receive sufficient feedback and direction to achieve their goals.
- Design holistic experiences and flows.


#### Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
_Simplicity and modulatrity drive maximum efficency._


**Design is about iteration, we continuously iterate on our processes.**

- Aggressively break down issues into the smallest effort that gets results.
- The design system will never be finished; it should always be evolving.
- Always, start in low-fidelity (sketches, wireframes, greyscale, etc.) to make sure we get it right before we go any further.
- Reuse components, buttons, type-styles, layout skeletons, form-fields, etc. to save effort and time for the deeper design thinking.


**Minimize distractions and clutter so users can focus.**

- Understand the users' journey and goals.
- Create hierarchy and a sense of direction to guide users through the flow.
- Maintain a strong information architecture.
- Don't be afraid to remove things that don't contribute to the user flow.


#### Human
_Self-aware. Emotional, yet rational. Understandable and helpful._

The biggest, and most difficult part of designing for FinTech is turning a financial product into something that isn't just a transactional peice of software, but an emotional, and personal interaction.

**Ambition**

- Think big, but break it down into small steps.
- Don’t be afraid to ask stupid questions, or propose new ideas.
- We're a small yet talented company; we should embrace it and push the products we work on to always be great.


**Empathy**

- See the world through other people's eyes, and try to understand their experiences deeply and meaningfully.
- Don’t overload the user.
- Don’t reinvent the wheel, unless you need to.
- Assist your teammates, always.


## Workflow
The UX Department is one side of the Triangle Δ. We work alongside Product Managers (PMs), and Engineers (FE / BE). PMs are responsible for kicking-off projects, coordinating timelines, sprints, and deliverable dates. PMs facilitate communication between Kunai and the clients and give the creative team the space to create and develop the product.

UX is the pilot driving the product vision early in the process. We inform the vision by conducting research as well as facilitating discussion with clients, customers, PM, FE, and BE. We do the entire spectrum of design work from research, to sketching, sitemapping, prototyping, and designing gradients on buttons.


## Holistic UX
Though we structure our work around individual stages of the product (Plan, Manage, Create, etc.) we should not separate look, feel and process from what the user is trying to accomplish. We must maintain a focus on what the user needs to get done and how to deliver that in the most effective manner possible. This includes how users flow from one stage of the product to another. Maintaining a holistic overview of the path a user may take allows us to see the possible twists and turns along the way. With this knowledge, we can optimize the user experience.

It is the responsibiliy of each UX Designer to understand how users may flow in and out of their area of focus.


## Stable Counterparts
Every UX Designer and UX Researcher is aligned with a PM. The UXer is responsible for the same features their PM oversees. UXers work alongside PM and engineering at each stage of the process. Planning, discovery, implementation, and further iteration. The area a UXer is responsible for is part of their title, e.g. "UX Designer, Plan." You can see which area of the product each UX Designer is aligned with in the team org chart.

UXers may also serve as a "backup" designer for other areas of the product. This area will be listed on the team page under their title as an expertise, e.g. "Plan expert." UX backups should be just that, backups. They are there to conduct UX reviews on MRs when the UX Designer for that area is out. The UX lead for a given area should coordinate with the PM and their backup during scheduling for any work that is critical. Critical UX work is defined as any work that addresses an outage, a broken feature with no workaround, or the current workaround is unacceptable.


#### Everyone can contribute
The UX department is not solely responsible for the user experience at Kunai. Everyone is encouraged to contribute their thoughts and ideas on how we can make GitLab better. Open an issue and tell us about your idea. You can use just words or include images. These images can take a variety of forms, here are just a few examples:

- Drawings or sketches to convey your idea.
- Wireframes made using a software of your choosing (Balsamiq, Sketch, etc.).
- Low-fidelity mockups made by manipulating the DOM in the browser.
- High-fidelity mockups made using the Kunai Design Pattern Library.

If you are creating high-fidelity designs, please make sure to let others know that this is a proposal and needs UX review. You can ping anyone on the UX team for assistance.


## Iteration
Here at Kunai, iteration means making the smallest thing possible and getting it out as quickly as possible. Working like this allows us to reduce cycle time and get feedback from users faster so we can continue to improve quickly and efficiently.

Iteration isn't just one of GitLab’s six founding values, C.R.E.D.I.T, it is one of the foundational concepts in design thinking and user experience. Planning too far ahead without real-world feedback can cause you to build something that doesn't meet users needs.

Iteration is especially vital in an open-source community. Keeping changes small and iterative makes it easy for anyone to contribute. Here are some examples of how we are embracing the power of iteration and using it to build GitLab:

- We aggressively break issues down into the smallest scope possible. If an effort is too big to be completed in one milestone, then it is too big. Epics allow us to maintain a holistic view of an area while breaking the work down into an MVC.
- We keep a list of improvement issues that are actively seeking contributions from the community. They are small in scope, allowing the community to contribute designs or code to the issues. You can learn more about in the Community Contributions section of this handbook. You can also view the list of issues that need UX work.
- You may notice that our Design System has a lot of "to-do" items. Rather than try to tackle everything at once, we are gradually populating our component library and incrementally rolling those components out to production.

#### Kunai design project

The GitLab design project is primarily used by the UX Design team to host design files and hand them off for implementation. For details, please visit the README for the project.


#### Kunai Design System

The GitLab Design System was developed to increase iteration speed and bring consistency to the UI through the creation of reusable and robust components. This system helps keep the application DRY and allows designers to focus their efforts on solving user needs, rather than recreating elements and reinventing solutions. It also empowers Product, engineering, and the community to use these defined patterns when proposing solutions. The Design System can be viewed at design.gitlab.com. It is currently a work in progress.

The project and repository for design.gitlab.com can be found here.
