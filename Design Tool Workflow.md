# Design Tool Workflows





## Abstract

### Naming Structure

**File/Project Name**

ClientName - Project - Variation
ex. (Visa - Loyalty - Merchant App)

Enter the Hex Color of the clients branding.
ex. (Visa #1A1F71, AmEx #6CC4EE)

Descriptions of products should be unique and should simply describe the project that is held within that folder.

### Branching

**Branch Naming**

- Master
  - Ready for Review
    - Global - UpdateName
    - Feature - ChangeName

**Merging Rules**
 
 1. If there are multiple designers working on the same project, your teammate must merge your updates.
 2. Commit early and often
 3. Only Merge Master, after all Globals, Features, and Fixes have been merged to R2R. If team project, this should be done together.
 4. Please write accurate, descriptions of changes.
 5. Don't bulk multiple feature changes in one **SUPER** merge. Keep things simple and organized.

###### Using just Abstract



## Sketch

### Naming Structure

**File/Project Name**

ClientName - Project - Variation

### Symbol Structure

**Atomic Design**

Build all your files based on <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/">Brad Frost's Atomic Design System</a>

**Storage**

All Sketch Files should be stored in Abstract

**Libraries**

If you're using alternative libraries please make sure that they are also available in Abstract.

**Rules**

- Please, name all of your layers. No 'Rectangle 489'
- Group all components
- Make sure that all parts of your components and symbols are layered in order from top-left first to bottom-right last. (This way when we need to make changes to symbol (copy, colors, icons, etc.) it's easy and organized.)
- Keep all libraries and symbols updated.
- All Assets need to be exportable


## Zeplin

### Naming Structure

**File/Project Name**

ClientName - Project - Variation
ex. (EY - Doc Intelligence - DICR)

### Component Export

**How To Guide**

**Rules**

1. Make sure all assets in your Source file are exportable
2. Use distinct naming for each asset and component (ex. camera_ic)
3. Make sure to export your component symbols and organize them in Zeplin
4. Share Zeplin project with devs, clients, & PMs
